<h1>Praticando Scroll</h1>
<p>Stairway to heaven - Led Zeppelin</p>

<div onscroll="rolaAih()" id="teste">
There's a lady who's sure</br>
All that glitters is gold</br>
And she's buying a stairway to heaven</br>
When she gets there she knows</br>
If the stores are all closed</br>
With a word she can get what she came for</br>
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh</br>
And she's buying a stairway to heaven</br>
There's a sign on the wall</br>
But she wants to be sure</br>
'Cause you know, sometimes words have two meanings</br>
In a tree by the brook</br>
There's a songbird who sings</br>
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven</br>
Ooh, it makes me wonder</br>
Ooh, it makes me wonder</br>
There's a feeling I get</br>
When I look to the west</br>
And my spirit is crying for leaving</br>
In my thoughts I have seen</br>
Rings of smoke through the trees</br>
And the voices of those who stand looking</br>
Ooh, it makes me wonder</br>
Ooh, it really makes me wonder</br>
And it's whispered that soon</br>
If we all call the tune</br>
Then the piper will lead us to reason</br>
And a new day will dawn</br>
For those who stand long</br>
And the forests will echo with laughter</br>
Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, oh-oh</br>
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now</br>
It's just a spring clean for the May Queen</br>
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run</br>
And there's still time to change the road you're on</br>
And it makes me wonder</br>
Oh, whoa</br>
Your head is humming and it won't go</br>
In case you don't know</br>
The piper's calling you to join him</br>
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?</br>
And did you know</br>
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?</br>
And as we wind on down the road</br>
Our shadows taller than our soul</br>
There walks a lady we all know</br>
Who shines white light and wants to show</br>
How everything still turns to gold</br>
And if you listen very hard</br>
The tune will come to you at last</br>
When all are one and one is all, yeah</br>
To be a rock and not to roll</br>
And she's buying a stairway to heaven</div>
